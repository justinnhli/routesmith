focus on just positioning for now

focus on just three attributes for now
width
depth
orientation

pull direction along the wall
directionality variance on the plane of the wall
effort required to hang on the hold perpendicular to the wall
effort required to match on the hold
effort required to hang in direction of pull
forgiveness for overshooting


how do pinches, which can be used in multiple directions, fit into this framework?
there may be multiple directionals and variances
note that you can pull down on a pinch - the multiple directionality thing doesn't help there
this suggests that pinches are is own dimension

what are the independent effects of wall geometry and hold position?
imagine a vertical line of matchable rings
on anything up to vertical, would be a "classic" V0 - a ladder
as the wall becomes steeper, the route gets harder - but no more than V3 when it becomes a roof
well, what would you rate a set of monkey bars? V2?

okay, now imagine two vertical lines of non-matchable rings
imagine in between, the wall bends to either be an arete, a face, or a dihedral

or would be ideal if I don't have to do any physics simulations

project goals
generate random bouldering caves given room dimensions
generate random bouldering problems given wall and difficulty (and maybe movement)
assess the difficulty of a bouldering problem
solve a bouldering problem
create climbing animations
