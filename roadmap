focus on just positioning for now

focus on just three attributes for now
width
depth
orientation

pull direction along the wall
directionality variance on the plane of the wall
effort required to hang on the hold perpendicular to the wall
effort required to match on the hold
effort required to hang in direction of pull
forgiveness for overshooting


how do pinches, which can be used in multiple directions, fit into this framework?
there may be multiple directionals and variances
note that you can pull down on a pinch - the multiple directionality thing doesn't help there
this suggests that pinches are is own dimension
