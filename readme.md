ROUTESMITH
==========

Routesmith is an indoor bouldering/climbing simulator. The finished product should be able to (in no particular order):

* display a problem
* assess the difficulty of a problem
* provide beta for a problem
* generate random problems given a wall and a difficulty (and maybe required movements)
* generate random bouldering caves given room dimensions
* create climbing animations

The original goal of the project is to easily generate the diagrams used by the [Routecrafting blog](http://routecrafting.blogspot.com/), which this project is not associated with. With a 3D representation of a wall and holds, however, the natural extension is to see if the thought process of a climber can be captured, which eventually led to the above goals.
